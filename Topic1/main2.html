    <h2>British x Manila</h2>
    <p>In 1762, during the Seven Years' War, Bristish forces led by Brigadier-General William Draper and Rear Admiral Samuel Cornish capture Manila, the capital of the Spanish Philippines, and occupied it for an 18-month period. Which exposed Spain's weakness and vulnerability.</p>

        <h2>Protection</h2>
        <p>Diego Silang, a leader of the Ilocano people, believed that Ilocanos needed to protect themselves from the British because he perceived that Spain was unable to defend them, leading him to declare an independent state of Free Ilocos.

        <h2>Persuation</h2>
        <p>Silang insisted that since British captured the power of the Spaniards, the people should stop paying their taxes, and instead focus their resources on defending themselves from the British.</p>
