    <h2>Analysis of Diego Silang's Letter</h2>

    <div class="convictions">
        <img src="https://galelawgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/felonyconviction.jpg" alt="Convictions">
        <h2>Silang's convictions did not possess an anti-colonial character</h2>
    </div>

        <h2>Sacrifice</h2>
        <p>In the process of going against the Spaniards, he was willing to make himself and his province subject to another colonial power.</p>

    <h3>What we need to understand about Silang's context</h3>

    <div class="idea">
        <img src="https://cdn.create.vista.com/api/media/medium/470751868/stock-photo-astonished-african-american-man-having-idea-isolated-pink?token=" alt="Idea">
        <h2>Idea</h2>
        <p>The idea of Nation was still nonexistent in 1762. Silang's imagination was limited to his locality</p>
    </div>

    <div class="demand">

        <h2>Demand</h2>
        <p>Silang's demand was anchored on practical matters and not on some ideals. (Burden to the common masses)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="revolt">
        <img src="https://blackthen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/slave-rebellon1-560x310.jpg" alt="Revolt">
        <h2>Revolt</h2>
        <p>Revolts that took place during the Spanish period were not always anti-colonial. They rebelled against the abuses but have not thought of a future without a colonial power.</p>
